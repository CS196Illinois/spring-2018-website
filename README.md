## Server
To run, do `./runserver.sh`
In order to have the server listen on port 80, must be run as sudo

## Credentials
To use this service you will need to have access to the course Google Drive
and set up a service account as shown in the *gspread* documentation [here](http://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html)

The Google Drive API also needs to be enabled for this, and course files will
need to be shared with the email in the credentials file.

## An Easier Way
A configured testing environment will be set up by the infra team and made
available for course staff. Contact Duke at *wdv2@illinois.edu* for access.
